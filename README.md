6th assignment for INFO 6150 

REQUIREMENTS 

WEBPAGE DESCRIPTION 

Being the metalhead that I am, I went with a metallica landing page and merch page website. never had so much fun creating an assignment, maybe because it was related to something that I am passionate about.ðŸ˜…
the landing page has a hero section, info section for current members, a card for the late Clifford D Burton and a footer.

LANDING PAGE 
- hero section has a nav, background image(with gradient for better visibility) and descriptive text that is absolutely positioned.
- Nav has link to the merch page as well, flexbox is used for this (nested flexbox, as I wanted to move the merch and user icon together to the right)
- the info sections have text and bootstrap carousel that are set to autorotate the images, buttons have been removed from the carousel. grid is used for this 
- Cliff section is designed similarly to the hero section, the text is kept on the top left, positioning suits well in my humble opinion.
- footer has the link to official metallica website and their instagram as well, usage of flexbox 

MERCH PAGE
- similar hero section with a different image 
- grid is used here for the product section 
- filter accordion is made to take the entire first column using span property of grid
- footer is similar as the landing page 

FLEXBOX IMPL

- header and footer for the merch page 

CSS GRID IMPL
- current member section on the landing page. 2 columns, equal width using 1fr for both, 4 rows.
- merch-grid section of the merch page. span is used to span the filter entire first column and the rest of the sale-item cards take the open spaces 

SASS IMPL

- VARIABLES - used for colors, font-sizes and a few other css properties 
- CUSTOM PROPERTIES - used for colors of buttons for sale-items

PS
original scope of the webapp was way bigger than what has been implemented, hence the abundance of images, of past members and extra banners.
